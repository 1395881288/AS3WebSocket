ActionScript 3 WebSocket Client

This is an AS3 implementation of a client library of the WebSocket protocol, as specified in the -06 draft.

I intend to keep this library updated to the latest draft of the IETF WebSocket protocol when new versions are released.  I built this library because I wanted to be able to make use of the latest draft of the protocol, but no browser implements it yet.

See the protocol draft specification at http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-06.txt


The AS3WebSocket directory contains a Flash Builder 4 Library Project that contains the WebSocket client library.

The testApp directory contains a Flash Builder 4 Air Project that uses the AS3WebSocket library and implements two of the test subprotocols from Andy Green's libwebsockets test server, the dumb-increment-protocol, and the lws-mirror-protocol.  For more detail about the libwebsockets test server, see http://git.warmcat.com/cgi-bin/cgit/libwebsockets


Known Issues:
- Fragmentation is not yet supported
- There is no extension mechanism implemented
